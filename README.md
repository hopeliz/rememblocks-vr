# Rememblocks VR

## About
*Rememblocks VR* was a virtual reality game I made for [the Digital Sideshow](http://thedigitalsideshow.com/) that ran March 6-7, 2020, at [Peebles Public Library](https://adamscolibrary.org/locations/) in Adams County, Ohio.

It is a memory game similar to Simon, but exploits the 3D space.

This project was also submitted to the [Virtual 2020 Ohio University Student Research and Creative Expo](https://www.ohio.edu/studentexpo).

## How to Play

1. Once running, tap the "Play" cube to start.
2. There is a count down and blocks appear.
3. A random block will light up and a tone will play.
4. Tap the same block that lit up.
5. The first block and a random second block will light up and play a tone.
6. Tap the blocks in the same order.
7. Each time, a random block will be added to the sequence.
8. If you wait too long or play the blocks out of order, the round ends with a random "fail" event.
9. If you reach at least five correct cubes in the sequence, you move to a more challenging level, otherwise, the game ends.

There are eight levels. Pressing the number on the keyboard will allow you to skip levels.

## Notes

It was built to have a person facilitate the game instead of a player having control over settings. However, a standalone version is planned.

## To Do

* Create a standalone version with access to settings, including accessibility features
* Fix the broken glass sound
